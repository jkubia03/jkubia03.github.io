	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>My name is Jenna Kubiak. I grew up in Sharon, Massachusetts, a small town about 40 minutes south of Boston. I now attend Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts where I study civil engineering. Although civil engineering is my primary focus of study, I have also taken numerous computer science courses. Outside of class I participate in multiple extracurricular activities including the American Society of Civil Engineers and JumboCode, a group aimed at providing software development for nonprofit organizations. In addition, I also enjoy spending time outside, hiking and skiing.
